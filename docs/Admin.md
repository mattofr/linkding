# Linkding administration

In the linkding administration page you can manage users.
Linkding also allows you to do some bulk operations, like archiving bookmarks tagged with a certain tag.
Also you can delete tags or bookmarks.

This page describes some main administration functions.

## Linkding administration page

Go to the linkding administration page. 
You do this by opening the URL http://[ip-address]:9090/admin.

## User management

Go to the linkding administration page and select "Users".
Here you can add and delete users, and change the password of a user.

Once you have added a user you can, if needed, give the user staff status, which means this user can access the linkding administration page.

## Bulk operations on bookmarks tagged with a certain tag

In the linkding administration page you have several options, among which operations on bookmarks and operation on tags.
First select the bookmarks to operate on.

- Click on the "bookmarks" link in the linkding administration page.
- In the column "by tags", choose the tag.

Now a list of bookmarks, which are tagged with this tag, is opened, each bookmark on a separate line.
Each line starts with a checkbox.
Choose the bookmarks you want to do a bulk operation on, or choose the top checkbox to select all shown bookmarks.

Open the "Action" select box to choose the desired bulk operation:

- Delete
- Archive
- Unarchive

## Bulk archiving or unarchiving

Linkding allows you to archive bookmarks. You can archive individual bookmarks, but also perform a bulk archive operation.

First select the bookmarks to operate on.
There are several ways to select bookmarks.

- Use the search box to do a text query.
- Select bookmarks by tag (see above).
- Select by archived or by unarchived.
- Select by user (if you have more than one user in linkding).

After this you will have a list of bookmarks, each on a separate line. 
Each line starts with a checkbox.
Choose the bookmarks you want to do a bulk operation on, or choose the top checkbox to select all shown bookmarks.

Open the "Action" select box to choose the desired bulk operation:

- Archive
- Unarchive

## Tag management

In the main linkding administration page, choose "tags".

You can now select one or more tags and choose to delete those tags.
Deleting a tag does not affect the bookmarks that are tagged with this tag, it only removes the tag from those bookmarks.
